  Color Collage no.8 is an original ACEO collage. ACEO means Art Cards Editions and Originals and measure 2.5 x 3.5 inches. I first cut out all the pieces from paint sample chips. Then I affix them to card stock and seal the surface for durability because the paint samples are quite delicate. This listing is for my un-framed piece.

  I love working with color! Creating art with paint samples allows me to travel easily with art supplies and work on projects more easily than transporting paints.
