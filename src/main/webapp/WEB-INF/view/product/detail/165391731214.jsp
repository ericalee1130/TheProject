    This jewelry art picture, made by Me, is made with  mostly vintage jewelry and a little current added in too. I have been collecting jewelry for a while now and thought I would try my hand at this form of art. When I first started selling items they were mostly handmade. Hence the name Blissful Creations. I do like creating things and thought I would give this a try. I have seen a lot of this kind of art on different platforms for a lot of money. I really can not justify charging astronomical prices, therefore I am offering mine at a fraction of the cost of some of the others. I think it is important that the pieces are affordable so people can enjoy your creativity. With that being said, this would make a lovely addition to your Easter, Spring or Mother's day Décor not to mention a thoughtful and unique gift.
