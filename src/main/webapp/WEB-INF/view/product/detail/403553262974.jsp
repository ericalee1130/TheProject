  Frank Kozik’s Ho Chi Minh statue.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Ho Chi Minh bust is from a limited edition of 50. Year of production is 2007 so it is pretty hard to find. It is made of resin and flocked in red. It has been stored in it’s original box since we purchased it in 2008. The condition is excellent. Any minor blemishes are from the original flocking process. It comes with a certificate of authenticity.
