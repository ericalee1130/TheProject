            All of our items have been stored in a temperature controlled environment with no pets or smoking allowed. We strive to provide a wide array of artwork, antiques, and collectibles for everyone from the casual collector to other gallery owners. Whether you are a collector or a reseller, we will always try to work with you to the best of our ability to sell you the item you are interested in. We are always adding new treasures to our collection so please feel free to make an offer, as we constantly are turning over our inventory and need to free space up for our newest finds. We will never decline or ignore an offer. We look at every offer and if we don't accept it, we will make a fair counter offer. We took a few months off of Ebay to move our inventory in to a larger space but we are now back, better than ever. Please check our 100% seller feedback to see that we describe our items accurately and take much care in packing our items so they arrive safe and fast. We always offer free shipping within the United States and also offer international shipping at very reasonable rates. If you are bidding from another country, please contact us prior to making a bid or offer so we can quote you a fair shipping cost. If you have any questions, please message us prior to bidding or making an offer and we will respond within 24 hours. Thank you for checking out our listing, and we look forward to dealing with you.
