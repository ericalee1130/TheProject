                  The first United Nations Conference to address environmental degradation was held in Stockholm in 1972. Already at that time the designer Carlos Sobral was working with resin and creating new techniques and alternative products to reuse all the raw material he consumed in the production of his collections. All Sobral production strictly follows the current environmental standards; however, Sobral goes further by putting into practice the zero disposal of raw material. In addition, Sobral jewelry protects fauna and flora when it replaces what would be made from scarce materials impacting the environment such as ivory, turtle, precious stones, metals, woods and etc.. The international recognition of his work took place in New York at the Global Fashion Awards, WGSM, in 2010, when Sobral received the award of one of the three most environmentally friendly companies in the world.

                  Every Sobral piece I sell is signed plus it either has the Sobral tag or is on the Sobral earring card. Also included is a Sobral fabric jewelry pouch.  Because these are artist made there are no two pieces which are the same and all my ads have the photo of the exact piece you will be receiving, unless if I have multiple similar pieces available. No unfortunate surprises when you open your parcel. I have full confidence in the Sobral product which is why I offer a return policy if for any reason you are not satisfied. If you buy more than one item I will be more than happy to combine shipping. All my items have been stored in a smoke free environment.
