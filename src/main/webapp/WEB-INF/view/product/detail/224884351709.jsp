 Rare vintage Helen Webber tapestry, signed and dated 1980s, 10 out of 100 made.  Pattern of flowers and I think abstract bird, great wall textile art. Not sure if this qualifies as antique, mid century or postmodern, anyway it's a very pretty, well-made, and rare tapestry.  It's been in storage and is somewhat rumped/creased but I am sure any competent person could iron that out.  It's a heavy what feels like cotton applique.
