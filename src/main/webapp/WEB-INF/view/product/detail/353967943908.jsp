         Online market facilitators such as eBay are required to collect and remit sales taxes for online purchases in some states. eBay will add the sales tax at checkout and collect the tax from the buyer and remit it to the state. For a list of the states that this doesn't effect, please contact eBay. EBAY will be adding state sales tax at the time of checkout. This tax is not implemented by WWolst12, and WWolst12 cannot remove or alter this tax during eBay checkout. If you can provide EBAY with a copy of your sales tax ID, then sales tax will be removed.
