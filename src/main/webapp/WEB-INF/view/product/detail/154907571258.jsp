  Daniel Johnston Original art Marker Pen On Paper. “Say Hello To Sam”. Rare 70’s.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Original art is float mounted and framed in a black frame. This is a rare and early piece attributed to the late 1970’s and shoes Daniel’s eccentric and creative creature.

  I have been collecting Daniel’s work since 2006 and the family is expanding and I am running out of room! Time to let someone else enjoy this piece!

  As with many of Daniels works, there are imperfections/small creases to paper. This gives work its character, charm and lends to authenticity.
