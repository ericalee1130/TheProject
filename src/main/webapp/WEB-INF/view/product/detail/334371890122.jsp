    This is a fantastic hand carved one of a kind wooden female nude in the art deco style. I believe the wood is ebony as it is a very heavy dark hard wood. No makers marks. In very good gently used condition. Please view all photos with care. Measurements 12.1/8" high x 2.7/8" wide x 2.5/8" deep. Weight one pound and eight point four ounces.
