     Kevin Red Star, born in 1943, on the Crow Reservation in Lodge Grass, Montana,showed his unique artistic talents at an early age. He attended the prestigious Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, N.M., and is the first artist trained there to be invited back as Artist-in-Residence. He also studied on a scholarship at the San Francisco Art Institute.

     <br/>
     The artist's works (oils, watercolors, etchings, woodblock prints and serigraphs) are related to and inspired by his culture. His subject matter is almost exclusively Crow; he is an interpreter of his culture to the world at large. Many of his subjects focus on the era of history at the turn of the century when the culture was in a state of dramatic transition.

     Since 1975, when his first one-man show sold out in two hours, his reputation has continued to expand. In 1977, he was one of 21 American artists exhibited in Japan and has been featured as the major artist in a group exhibit at the Espace Pierre Cardin in Paris, France. His work has been exhibited in Peking, China and in 1983, his work shown at a major exposition in Berlin, earned him an interview on West German T.V. One of his most distinctive recent honors; however, was the selection of his painting "The Flag Carrier" for the invitation and poster for the Night of the First Americans in 1982, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     His works are included in the permanent collections of the San Diego Museum of Man, the Denver Museum, and the Museum of the American Indian in N.Y.
