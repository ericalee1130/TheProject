        Greetings and Thank you for visiting us on eBay where we sell Scott's carvings. The Lord has blessed us with many new friends through the years, as our carvings have traveled throughout this great land and the world! We are a two person team with Scott doing all the carving and Heidi (that’s me) handling the eBay sales. These carvings are carved into the thick bark from the Cottonwood Tree. Scott says, "Making faces just comes natural; and I truly believe God has given us all gifts. I also see a correlation in taking something that's only other purpose in life was going to be firewood and turning it into something beautiful. I give Jesus the glory for the gift and also my life. No two are ever just alike. They are made to hang on the wall and sure to bring a smile to all.
        <br/>
        SHIPPING: We ship our carvings out after receiving payment - Tuesday through Friday. Thank you, and Have a Great Day!
        <br/>
        Scott &amp; Heidi Powers
