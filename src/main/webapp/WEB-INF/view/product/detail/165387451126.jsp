    These are from 
the estate of friend John Renner who was an avid collector of male 
photography and other media, and a patron of photographers.  His taste ran to well-built 
athletic figures, and then some - including beyond purely 
representational.  His collection numbered 200+ lush photography books 
of images and critique, and some 1000 images.  Some of it has gone to 
museums, some to local buyers, the rest to auction.  John was an amateur trapezist himself and collected a bounty of non-photographic art of trapeze movies, artists, circus, and vernacular.

    We found no records of the collection - John's RennerGallery.com website expired and all data went with.  No records were found on his computer, so the only info we have is with the artwork.

    These 7 pieces are by three artists.  Six are pencil or conte, one is a monoprint. The first image shows 4 originals: the brown paper drawing is by Andrew lastname-not-legible, and is an 8x10". There is a 4 1/2 x 6 monoprint by L. Novak. The yelllow/brown drawing is ~ 5 x 6 1/2", and the green drawing of the nude trapezist is a 6x10", both by "FD", who also did the last 3 pieces, which are 8 1/2 x 11" reproductions of his nude pencil drawings of trapezists and a stretching, splayed nude.  These vary in detail but all are tactile in the rendering of muscle, curves and light and shadow.
